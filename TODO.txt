Marcus:
- MUTEX everything - that means:
  	-server_list, definitely for writes, maybe for reads (probably not)
		      writes happen in:
		      	     rpc_receive_update
			     get_servers (although) it doesn't really make sense to lock at that point

	-Perhaps other things


Micheal:
-runner code
	-Make a new .c file runner .c
	-add an entry in the make file
	-make sure to add a dependency on the bulletin.o code
	-make sure to import runner.h in server.c
