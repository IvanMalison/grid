NOTE: Always use safe_send and safe_receive for network comms!

TODO:
Update host_ip struct:
       -Change name?
       	       -host_ip makes no sense
	       -should be host_port
       -add int to contain last known number of jobs
       -add connection_failed flag for failure

Write heartbeat code:
      -this

Failure code:
	- Deal with connection failures
	  -should be somewhat easier with safe_send safe_recv
	  	  -what should be done on a transmission failure
		  	-try again? continue without
	- Write server_comm_failed - this marks the connection_failed flag in the host_ip struct
	  - this should be called when we fail to connect
	  	- needs to alert everyone
		-if server_comm_failed is called again and the connectio_failed flag is set we:
		    -remove the node entirely?
		    -put it in dormant state?
	-

Marcus:
- MUTEX everything - that means:
  	-server_list, definitely for writes, maybe for reads (probably not)
		      writes happen in:
		      	     rpc_receive_update
			     get_servers (although) it doesn't really make sense to lock at that point

	-Perhaps other things


Micheal:
-runner code
	startup:
		-Make a new .c file runner.c
		-add an entry in the make file
		-make sure to add a dependency on the bulletin.o object file
		-make sure to import runner.h in server.c
	methods:
		-request_job_local -look in the local queue first
